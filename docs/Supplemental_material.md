# Used test image datasets

All tests were carried out on three image datasets: the JenAesthetics dataset, a set of 1000 random phase images generated by Branka Spehar and a sample of 1000 image from the AVA dataset. The test data can be downloaded [here (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T6wK-7xguIos0fzj_O9bVEWajDtPMDvG/view?usp=sharing).
