# Used test image datasets

All tests were carried out on three image datasets: the JenAesthetics dataset, a set of 1000 random phase images generated by Branka Spehar and a sample of 1000 image from the AVA dataset. The test data can be downloaded [here (google drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tytnRFS-PIBdKPJKdt7XODErUskEM-Z_/view?usp=sharing).



# QIP_correlations

This folder Supplemental_material/QIPcorrelations contains csv-files with the spearman correlations between all QIPs for the 3 different test datasets. 


# Effect of resizing images

The Supplemental_material/Effect of resizing images folder contains csv files with the calculated QIPs for the original version of all three test datasets and the resized version of the test datasets. In the second resized version, all images have been downscaled to 2/3 of their original resolution. The csv file QIP_Deviations_Original_vs_Resized_images.csv reports the absolute difference, the percentage difference and the Spearman correlation for all QIPs between both versions of the test datasets. With the exception of Fourier Sigma (0.6), all Spearman correlations are approximately 0.9 or higher.
